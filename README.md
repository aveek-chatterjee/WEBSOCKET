# WEBSOCKET
Implementing Web Sockets
Hello!!

After cloning the project, please open two terminals, from the root directory.

Run the below commands in both the terminals sequentially: 
 > cd client
 > npm install
 > npm start

We will see the server code running in port number 3001 & the react client application running in port number 3000.
